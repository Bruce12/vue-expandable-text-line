# vue-expandable-text-line

A simple **Vue** component that clips a long text into a single line with `â€¦` (ellipsis), and expands it with a transition to it's full length on `mouseover` or `click`.

## Installation

```
$ npm i vue-expandable-text-line
```

## Usage

#### Script
```javascript
import ExpandableTextLine from 'vue-expandable-text-line'
export default {
  components: { ExpandableTextLine }
}
```
#### Template 
```html
<expandable-text-line>
  <!--Your text or html goes here-->
</expandable-text-line>
```
By default it will be expanded on `hover`.
If you would like to do this on `click` instead, you can add `use-click` argument:
```html
<expandable-text-line use-click>
  <!--Your text or html goes here-->
</expandable-text-line>
```
*Note:* If a `touch` event is detected, then regardless of whether `use-click` is present or not, the `touch` event will be used to trigger the transition.

#### CSS
The component has only functional css. In order to style it you can add your own class or a style tag:
```html
<expandable-text-line class="whatever-class-name">
  <!--Your text or html goes here-->
</expandable-text-line>
```
